# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is a game-developement project of Sorting algorithm visualizer. The GUI is built with PyGame module.
this is a visual representation of sorting algorithms aimed for sorting various rectangles of variable heights
according to the algorithm paradigm.
Along with sorting, the various time complexities of different bounds are also displayed.

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/yash11213018/Visualizer
```

### Prerequisites
```
Pre-Installed Python 3.6 or above along Pygame Module
```

### Installing

If Pygame Module is missing, please Install it using below command in your terminal


```
pip install pygame
```

Or Simply Download the module package

```
https://pypi.org/project/pygame/
```

## Features
* keys like 1,2,3,4 are designated to various sorting algorithms.
* reset option is provided for resetting and randomizing the heights of rectangles to display an unsorted fashion.
* worst,best and average cases are provided with respect to the selected sorting algorithm.
* a time-mapper stopwatch is provided to map the actual time required for sorting ad it's relevance to time bounds.
